            <h2><b>Site Redesign</b></h2>
	    <p>"Out with the old, in with the new" is a quote some people say. Well I decided to redesign my website to the opposite phrase; "Out with the new, in with the old!"</p>
            <p>As of recent, I've been slowly redesigning my webpage from a completly modern looking page <sup>(aside from maybe a massive gradient and the fact I will never use flexboxes)</sup> to what it is now, something that looks like it could have been made 20 years ago. I've recently fallen down a rabbithole of old internet content, and it has inspired me to redesign my site. I haven't modified any actual content other than the random edits I do every now and again, mostly the css was just massivly changed. 
	    <p>As an example, here a couple of the changes I have made thus far: <ul>
		    <li>Made the html element have the gradient as opposed to the body</li>
		    <li>Made the body less wide, as if it were to fit onto a smaller screen</li>
		    <li>Added some little buttons at the bottom in my footer</li>
		    <li>Made my little Floood logo at the top smaller</li>
		    <li>Made all the colors websafe, because now it is more dangerous than ever muhuhahaha</li>
		    <li>Added borders around everything. Everything must be bordered!! <sup>(try not to cut yourself on those borders, they look kinda sharp)</sup></li>
		    <li>And more that I can't think of <sup>(you expect this to be a changelog or somethin?)</sup></li>
		</ul>
	    </p>
	    <p>For the css and html, I tried to make sure it would all function on older browsers, but I really got no clue how far I got with that, though I know everything works perfectly on the latest version of Internet Explorer. <sup>(not edge, I'm not stupid)</sup> I think the changes turned out really good looking, and if you ever have any cool ideas for what I can do next, feel free to email me, I promise I'll try and check!!</p>
