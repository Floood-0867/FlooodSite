            <h2><b>The beginning of an adventure!</b></h2>
            <p>This is the beginning of my website. I've always wanted to make a website, but never had the time or resources.
            <br>That is until now! Today I started my adventure into the world of having a website. On my website, I plan to post journal/diaries for my general life, and I want to post updates on all the projects that I am working on. I am a person with quite a many interests, such as music production, game design/development, and more!</p>
            <p>I used the <a href="https://landchad.net" rel="noopener noreferrer">landchad.net</a> guide to help me set up the website for the internet, and I designed my website with random stack overflow pages as well as a 6 year old book on html and css. I hope to be able to share all the things I want on this page, as well as all the smaller things that I am interested in. </p>
            <p>Some projects I hope to share on this webpage include, but are not limited to: <ul>
                <li>A discord bot that can record quotes</li>
                <li>A game in which, when you run into a certain object, your movement is restricted to the direction the object is facing</li>
                <li>All of my musical endeavors</li>
                
                               
            </ul></p>
            <p>Anyways, I hope to continue updates about life here. Thank you for reading my first journal.</p>
