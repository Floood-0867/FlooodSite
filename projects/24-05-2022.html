            <h2><b>Quote Bot</b></h2>
            <p>Quote Bot is a discord bot project I have been working on for a while. It is a discord bot that counts quotes and saves them to a database. This bot was written, funnily enough, in Godot Game Engine, something of which I find very funny. </p>
            <p>I've started making this bot, because of a quotes page on my school discord server. I was getting tired of manually counting up the quotes to figure out who was the quote master, so I decided to automate the process with a discord bot. When I started, I had no idea what to use to make the bot, so I decided to check if there was a discord library for the Godot Game Engine. As it turns out, there was! The bot uses the <a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1010" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord.gd</a> library by 3ddelano.<br>Anyways, I began drawing up some plans of what I would like to include in the bot. I started with the idea of saving quotes to a JSON file and then using certain commands to count them. I soon realized that it would be good to give server admins more tools to modify the bot themselves, so I added a few commands like that. This continued for a while until I figured out all of the things I wanted to add.</p>
            <p>At the current point in the discord bots prosses, I've added many funcions. I will list them here:
                <ul>
                    <li>Recieving quotes from a discord server and adding them to a database</li>
                    <li>Counting all quotes in the quote database</li>
                    <li>Counting quotes in the quote database, but sorting by who has said what</li>
                    <li>Saves all quotes to a server specific JSON file</li>
                    <li>Custom admin role to be set by server owner</li>
                    <li>Configuration file, done by server</li>
                    <li>Seperate admin and normal help pages</li>
                    <li>Clearing the database with a command</li>
                    <li>Exporting the JSON file out of the server and sending through discord</li>
                    <li>Editing quotes that are already in the quote database</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, Quote Bot is a fun little discord bot that was made to count quotes, but now serves many more functions. A bot invite link and a link to the github page will soon be added, and all will be happy.</p>
