            <h2><b>Quote Bot.. Rewritten in C++!</b></h2>
            <p>For a long time now I've wanted to optimize my original Quote Bot code, as I wanted to make it run as it's own thing and not in an engine, and seeing as I was going to have it run on an external server, I decided to drop the engine and rewrite it in C++.</p>
			<p>For the discord bot, I used the D++ library ,which can be found on <a href="https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>! The whole bot is compliled using CMAKE, although I'm very new to working with CMAKE and it has some small issues that I have not yet figured out, but I'm learning! I'm also trying to learn how to make a system that would handle the commands and make it easy to add, however I still have a lot to learn in C++, and have not yet figured it out.</p>
			<p>This bot currently has all the same features as the original version of the bot except for the edit feature, which I still need to complete. If you'd like to see all the features, refer to <a href="24-05-2022.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">my old blog</a>. A new thing of this bot is that it no longer uses discord's old system of doing commands <sub>(like q! or !)</sub>, and it instead uses discord's slash commands. My old bot's system in godot didn't even support slash commands! This has been and will continue to be a cool learning experience for me, and I can''t wait to learn more.</p>	
			<p>I do not know how much faster writing the code in C++ is compared to godot, however the fact that gd script is an interpreted language and C++ is a compiled language, as well as Godot runs more engine features wheras C++ is quite purely the libraries, indicates that the C++ version of the bot will run quite a bit faster. I'm sure there are many ways I could optimize my code better, but I'm not experienced enough with C++ to know these techniques.</p>
			<p>In conclusion, this complete rewrite of this discord bot has been a really fun project and a good learning experience. It is my first C++ project and I think I've done good for a first timer. This bot is not done yet, and I still have more to learn, but I'd like to see where this bot is headed! If you've read all this, thanks, and feel free to <a href="mailto: flooodmusic@gmail.com">shoot me an email</a> if you'd like to learn more!</p>
